# Project_CTR_Termux

This fork provides pre-compiled binaries of **Project_CTR** for use with **Termux on Android**.

The original project is a collection of custom Nintendo 3DS tools. This version saves you the step of compiling them yourself on your android device.

## Tools

*   [**ctrtool**](https://github.com/TheBlackCat778/Project_CTR_Termux/blob/master/ctrtool/README.md) - A tool to read/extract Nintendo 3DS files.
*   [**makerom**](https://github.com/TheBlackCat778/Project_CTR_Termux/blob/master/makerom/README.md) - Creates CTR cxi/cfa/cci/cia files.

[**Download All Binaries (v1.2.1)**](https://github.com/TheBlackCat778/Project_CTR_Termux/releases/tag/v1.2.1)

## Quick Start

After downloading, open Termux, make the files executable (`chmod +x <tool_name>`) and move them to `$PREFIX/bin` to use them anywhere.
